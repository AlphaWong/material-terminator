Material is a color scheme for Terminator (terminal emulator). It's a fork of PaperColor, a color scheme for Vim designed by NLKNguyen.

To install, add the contents of config to your .config/terminator/config (or replace it if you don't have a custom configuration) and it should appear on "profiles"

This is a WIP, so I'll be trying new colors and changing a bit the config. Let me know if you find any mistakes.
